## What I worked on

I have just started today. I’ve installed Cursor, set up an engineering diary and began to learn the HTML basics.

## Bugs or Blockers

Since I’ve just started, I havn’t made a project yet. So no Bugs or Blockers.

## Next Steps/Tomorrow

- Dive deeper into HTML
- Learn better how to use Cursor
- Set Up Git
