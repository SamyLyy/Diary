## Plan for Today

- [x] Set Up Git
- [x] Finish HTML Basics Theory
- []

## What I worked on

I didn’t do this much today, but I mainly did some organisation stuff like setting up Git and a Notion Page, which I could maybe link, if anyone wants it.

## Bugs or Blockers

Nothing big, but Git was a bit confusing at the beginning and I still don’t understand all of it.

## Next Steps/Tomorrow

Not only tomorrow, but in general I’m going to make a HTML only Website to test my Basics. Because Building is more important than theory.
